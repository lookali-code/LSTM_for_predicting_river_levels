# LSTM for Predicting River Levels Using Log-Signature Features
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with log-signature features from time-series sensor data to forecast river level readings in York.

Developed as part of a university dissertation focused on time-series modelling of hydrological data using log-signature methods.
